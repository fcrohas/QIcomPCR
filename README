QIcomPCR V0.1.0

First release

Description :

  This become to be a Qt interface for ICOM PCR xxxx devices. I can only test on PCR2500 without any accessories.
  There is a Qt GUI and also a Web Interface through nodejs to control remotely the ICOM in realtime.
  
  Actually the Web Interface and QT Interface are just proof of concept, in the Web interface i miss the sound feedback.

Dependancies :

	* For sound system Pulseaudio or PortAudio
	* If you want Acars, you can install libacarsd
	* If FFTW3 is provided it will be used
  
How to build :

	Using CMAKE for the Qt build part
