<BR>description:
<BR>Initial version of pcrd, the PCR1000 control daemon / command line
interface.
<BR>----------------------------
<BR>revision 1.15
<BR>date: 1999/06/29 23:04:45;&nbsp; author: cwalker;&nbsp; state: Exp;&nbsp;
lines: +5 -5
<BR>Added a usleep(50000) to the wait loop for the socket communications.
<BR>This will keep the radio command buffer from filling up and taking
<BR>a long time to reply to commands from the remote system. This should
<BR>fix the latency problems that people were having when trying to
<BR>write GUI interfaces to this program. It was dawg slow when the
<BR>radio buffer had filled up.
<BR>----------------------------
<BR>revision 1.14
<BR>date: 1999/03/15 21:52:57;&nbsp; author: cwalker;&nbsp; state: Exp;&nbsp;
lines: +157 -38
<BR>Updated and changed the socket reporting for freq. offset, squelch
<BR>state, signal, mode, and filter. This is more than likely the
<BR>last major (or minor) update to pcrd. I will be changing the
<BR>overall form of the program from a C based, single radio type
<BR>program, to a C++ based, write a radio class and drop it in
<BR>type of program, that will have support for the PCR-1000
<BR>and the Kenwood TS-440 to start with (as these are the only
<BR>two radios that I own that have serial port control).
<P>Stay tuned.
<BR>----------------------------
<BR>revision 1.13
<BR>date: 1999/01/31 21:03:21;&nbsp; author: cwalker;&nbsp; state: Exp;&nbsp;
lines: +28 -24
<BR>Filter data if the reply packet to a query is 'bad'.
<BR>Indicate uptime of the daemon.
<BR>More minor cleanup.
<BR>----------------------------
<BR>revision 1.12
<BR>date: 1999/01/29 01:39:40;&nbsp; author: cwalker;&nbsp; state: Exp;&nbsp;
lines: +94 -46
<BR>Added a timeout so that the daemon will exit if communications
<BR>are lost with the target radio.
<P>Added some other minor refinements. Version to 0.07
<P>This code seems stable and has had uptimes in excess of two days
<BR>with the last revision. Now it will be time to add more features
<BR>and muck things up a bit. :-)
<BR>----------------------------
<BR>revision 1.11
<BR>date: 1999/01/27 02:00:24;&nbsp; author: cwalker;&nbsp; state: Exp;&nbsp;
lines: +34 -11
<BR>Added reporting of remote connected host on the socket.
<BR>----------------------------
<BR>revision 1.10
<BR>date: 1999/01/26 02:28:14;&nbsp; author: cwalker;&nbsp; state: Exp;&nbsp;
lines: +4 -3
<BR>Don't do socket setup unless we are in
<BR>daemon mode.
<BR>----------------------------
<BR>revision 1.9
<BR>date: 1999/01/24 20:52:32;&nbsp; author: cwalker;&nbsp; state: Exp;&nbsp;
lines: +47 -22
<BR>Changed reporting so that f_offset will not be shown unless
<BR>in nfm mode. Other minor code cleanup. Version to 0.05.
<BR>----------------------------
<BR>revision 1.8
<BR>date: 1999/01/23 15:34:05;&nbsp; author: root;&nbsp; state: Exp;&nbsp;
lines: +70 -7
<BR>Fixed the problem where the newly connected socket from the remote
system
<BR>was not set to non blocking. Now it is, and the radio gets commands
sent
<BR>to it during the time that pcrd is waiting for a new command from the
<BR>remote system. Cleaned up a spelling error or two.
<BR>----------------------------
<BR>revision 1.7
<BR>date: 1999/01/23 02:27:49;&nbsp; author: root;&nbsp; state: Exp;&nbsp;
lines: +378 -171
<BR>Added uptime counter, displayed when connected to pcrd socket.
<BR>Added polling of radio power status while waiting for a connected
<BR>socket to deliver command data to pcrd. This allows infinite
<BR>amounts of time to pass while typing in a command string into a
<BR>telnet session without the radio timing itself out and turning
<BR>off. There was no way to recover from this except to kill the
<BR>daemon and restart it with the -i option. Silly me.
<BR>----------------------------
<BR>revision 1.6
<BR>date: 1999/01/21 22:06:54;&nbsp; author: root;&nbsp; state: Exp;&nbsp;
lines: +3 -0
<BR>Fixed the bug that I added to socket command line parsing in the last
clean up rev!
<BR>----------------------------
<BR>revision 1.5
<BR>date: 1999/01/21 20:55:11;&nbsp; author: root;&nbsp; state: Exp;&nbsp;
lines: +452 -444
<BR>More cleanup, code style. Nothing major. This will be Release 0.03
<BR>----------------------------
<BR>revision 1.4
<BR>date: 1999/01/20 23:51:41;&nbsp; author: root;&nbsp; state: Exp;&nbsp;
lines: +159 -115
<BR>Added PID reporting when the daemon mode starts. Added -X command to
socket
<BR>mode to make the daemon exit.
<BR>----------------------------
<BR>revision 1.3
<BR>date: 1999/01/20 01:50:02;&nbsp; author: root;&nbsp; state: Exp;&nbsp;
lines: +5 -1
<BR>Fixed exiting on a signal, and reporting of child PID when entering
daemon mode.
<BR>----------------------------
<BR>revision 1.2
<BR>date: 1999/01/20 01:28:36;&nbsp; author: root;&nbsp; state: Exp;&nbsp;
lines: +154 -57
<BR>Added the daemon support, and signal support. Getting closer to initial
release.
<BR>----------------------------
<BR>revision 1.1
<BR>date: 1999/01/19 23:34:34;&nbsp; author: root;&nbsp; state: Exp;
